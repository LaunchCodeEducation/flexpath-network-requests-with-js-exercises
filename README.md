- Also, include instructions on how to open their terminal in 

- WHILE DOING THIS, LOOK OUT FOR ANY POTENTIAL WINDOWS FILE PATH ISSUES in exercises


## Exercise overview

Give quick overview about context of exercises and their intention


## Specific exercises listed in numbered order

Add disclaimer if exercises are stored inside of specific files as comments

Also, for a plain text reference, theres always the `EXERCISE-INSTRUCTIONS` files to pop open

To answer questions that don't require coding, please create a file in the repo named
